The MAT file 'shape_texture_samples_10e4.mat' contains several fields used to generate the shape and texture samples. Here is an explanation of each field:

1. b_shape_texture
- A matrix of shape (28, 10000) containing the shape and texture coefficients for 10,000 samples. Each column represents the coefficients for one sample.

2. chi_squared
- A scalar value (0.95) used in the generation process, likely representing a threshold for the chi-squared distribution.

3. nOfSamples
- A scalar value (10000) indicating the number of samples in the dataset.

4. var
- A scalar value (92) indicating the percentage of variance explained by the principal components.

The MAT file 'TextureShapeModelNormalized_symmetric_corrected.mat' contains a structure with the following elements:

1. triang
- The triangulation information for the 3D model. Each row represents a triangle defined by three vertex indices.

2. landmark_coords
- Coordinates of the landmarks in the 3D model.

3. landmark_names
- Names of the landmarks corresponding to the indices in 'landmark_verts'.

4. landmark_verts
- Indices of the vertices that correspond to specific landmarks on the face.

5. eigenVectors
- Principal component eigenvectors for the model. Each column represents a deformation mode of the face shape.

6. eigenValues
- Principal component eigenvalues for the model. They represent the variance explained by each component.

7. meanTextureShape
- The mean shape and texture vector.

8. pctVar_per_eigen
- Percentage of variance explained by each principal component.

9. mean_normalization_texture
- Mean values used for normalizing textures.

10. std_normalization_texture
- Standard deviation values used for normalizing textures.

11. lambda
- A scaling factor used in texture normalization.

12. epsilon
- A small constant used for numerical stability in calculations.

How These Fields are Used in the Main Script:

1. Loading and Normalizing Data:
- The 'b_shape_texture' matrix from 'shape_texture_samples_10e4.mat' provides the coefficients for reconstructing shape and texture.
- The 'TextureShapeModelNormalized_symmetric_corrected.mat' file provides the mean, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors necessary for this reconstruction.

2. Reconstructing Shape and Texture:
- The coefficients from 'b_shape_texture' are combined with the eigenvectors and the mean vector from 'TextureShapeModelNormalized' to reconstruct the synthetic shapes and textures.

3. Generating Synthetic Dataset:
- The script iterates over each sample, reconstructs the shape and texture, and applies transformations to generate synthetic images.

4. Normalization:
- The script uses the mean and standard deviation values from 'TextureShapeModelNormalized' to normalize and adjust the textures.

5. Saving Variables:
- Key variables such as the reconstructed vertices, triangulation, principal components, and landmark vertices are saved for later use.

The process involves reshaping and combining these components to generate and visualize synthetic models.
